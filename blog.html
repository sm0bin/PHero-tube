                <li class="mb-4">
                    Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope, which means
                    they can be accessed before they are declared, but their value will be undefined until the actual
                    declaration is reached.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of the block; they are only accessible after

                    The key difference is that const variables cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.

                    array can still be modified.

            <p>
                null is a deliberate assignment value representing the absence of any object value. It's often
                used when you want to indicate that a variable or property should have no value or that it's
                intentionally empty.

                <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Example: </bold> let myVar = null; // Explicitly setting a
                variable

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-3xl text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-3">undefined:</h3>
            <p>
                undefined is a primitive value that typically represents the unintentional absence of
                a
                value. Variables that are declared but not initialized, function parameters that are not
                provided,
                or non-existent object properties have the value undefined.
            </p>

                <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Example: </bold> let x; // x is undefined because it's declared

            <p class="text-xl mb-4">

                <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Definition:</bold> A REST API is an architectural style for designing
                networked applications. It is not a
                programming language or framework; instead, it's a set of principles and constraints that define how web
                services should be structured and how data should be exchanged over the internet.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl mb-4">
                REST technology is often favored over the more complex Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) due to its
                efficiency in terms of bandwidth usage and its simplicity and flexibility, making it particularly
                suitable for internet-based applications. REST is primarily used to request or provide information from
                a web service, and all communication within a REST API is exclusively based on HTTP requests.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl mb-4">
                <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Here's how it works:</bold> A client sends a request to a server in the
                form of a web URL using HTTP
                methods
                like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. Subsequently, the server responds with a resource, which can take
                various forms such as HTML, XML, images, or JSON. JSON has become the most prevalent format in modern
                web services.

            </p>

            <p class=" text-xl mb-4">
                <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Key Principles:</bold> Some key characteristics and concepts of REST
                APIs include:
            </p>

            <ul class="text-xl list-disc ml-5">

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Statelessness:</bold> Each request from a client to a server must
                    contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not rely
                    on any previous requests or stored client state.

                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Resources:</bold> Resources are the key abstractions in REST. Each
                    resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and can be manipulated using
                    standard HTTP methods like GET (Read), POST (Create), PUT (Update), and DELETE (Delete).
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">HTTP Methods:</bold> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods for CRUD
                    operations on resources.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Representation:</bold> Resources can have multiple representations
                    (e.g., JSON or XML), and clients can choose the representation they prefer.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">Stateless Communication:</bold> REST APIs use stateless
                    communication, making each request independent.
                </li>


            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
                In the realm of HTTP, there are five commonly used methods in a REST-based architecture: POST, GET, PUT,
                PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations,
                respectively.

            </p>

            <ul class="text-xl list-disc ml-5">

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">GET:</bold> The HTTP GET method is employed to retrieve a
                    representation of a resource. In a successful
                    scenario, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In case
                    of
                    an error, it typically returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">POST:</bold> The POST verb is primarily used to create new
                    resources, particularly subordinate resources.
                    Upon
                    successful creation, it returns an HTTP status of 201, along with a Location header containing a
                    link to
                    the newly-created resource. It's important to note that POST is neither safe nor idempotent.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">PUT:</bold> PUT is used for updating resources. However, it can
                    also create a resource when the client
                    chooses
                    the resource ID, rather than the server. If a PUT request is made to a URI containing a non-existent
                    resource ID, it creates that resource. On a successful update, PUT returns a status of 200 (or 204
                    if no
                    content is returned in the body). When used for creation, it returns an HTTP status of 201. PUT is
                    not
                    considered a safe operation but is idempotent.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">PATCH:</bold> This method is used to modify resources. A PATCH
                    request only needs to contain the changes to
                    the
                    resource, not the entire resource. It resembles PUT but uses a set of instructions in the body to
                    describe how the server's resource should be modified to create a new version. PATCH is neither safe
                    nor
                    idempotent.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">
                    <bold class="font-semibold mt-6">DELETE:</bold> DELETE is employed to delete a resource identified
                    by a URI. Upon successful deletion, it
                    returns an HTTP status of 200 (OK) along with a response body.
