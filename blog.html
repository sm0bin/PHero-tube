                    var declarations are function-scoped, meaning they are limited in scope to the function in which
                    they are declared.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope, which means
                    they can be accessed before they are declared, but their value will be undefined until the actual
                    declaration is reached.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    let declarations are block-scoped, meaning they are limited in scope to the nearest enclosing block,
                    such as a loop or an if statement.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">
                    Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of the block; they are only accessible after
                    the point at which they are declared.

                    const declarations are also block-scoped, just like let.

                <li class="mb-4">
                    The key difference is that const variables cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.
                    However, if the value assigned is an object or array, the properties or elements of the object or
                    array can still be modified.

                    null is a deliberate assignment value representing the absence of any object value. It's often
                    used when you want to indicate that a variable or property should have no value or that it's
                    intentionally empty.

                    javascript
                    Copy code
                    let myVar = null; // Explicitly setting a variable to have no value.
                </li>

                    undefined is a primitive value that typically represents the unintentional absence of
                    a
                    value. Variables that are declared but not initialized, function parameters that are not
                    provided,
                    or non-existent object properties have the value undefined.


                    let x; // x is undefined because it's declared but not assigned a value.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-5xl text-gray-700 mt-16 mb-8">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
            <!-- <h3 class="font-semibold text-3xl text-gray-700 mt-10 mb-3">const:</h3> -->

            <p class="text-xl mb-4">
                REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked
                applications.
                It's based on a set of principles and constraints that emphasize a stateless client-server interaction,
                scalability, and simplicity. Some key characteristics and concepts of REST APIs include:

            </p>




            <ul class="text-xl list-disc ml-5">

                <li class="mb-4">
                    Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to
                    understand
                    and fulfill the request. The server should not rely on any previous requests or stored client state.

                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    Resources: Resources are the key abstractions in REST. Each resource is identified by a unique URI
                    (Uniform
                    Resource Identifier) and can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
                    on
                    resources. For example, GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new data, PUT for updating data,
                    and
                    DELETE for removing data.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    Stateless Communication: REST APIs use stateless communication, meaning that each request from a
                    client to a
                    server is independent, and the server doesn't maintain any client state between requests. This makes
                    the API
                    scalable and easy to cache.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">

                    JSON or XML: Data is typically exchanged between the client and server in a format like JSON or XML,
                    making
                    it easy for different systems to understand and work with the data.
                </li>

                <li class="mb-4">
                    RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services and are the foundation of many web
                    applications and
                    services, providing a straightforward and scalable way to interact with data over the internet.

                </li>
            </ul>
